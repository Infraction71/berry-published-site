                <h3> Hello. My name is Matthew Berry. I am a junior studying computer science. I am from Johnston, which
                    in
                    the Des
                    Moines metro. My hobbies include fishing, bowling, wasting time, and watching football and an
                    excessive
                    amount
                    of
                    hockey, specifically those teams who originate from Nashville. I'm sure that won't be an issue at
                    all
                    this
                    weekend...

                    My goals after college is to get a job as a software developer, preferably back-end. I have some
                    experience
                    doing
                    back-end development when I was interning at a financial services institution in Des Moines. When I
                    was
                    there I
                    really enjoyed it, and I hope to continue similar work in 18(!) short months.



                    Something interesting about myself? I had the privilege of studying abroad in Birmingham, UK last
                    summer. There
                    I
                    studied ethical hacking.</h3>
