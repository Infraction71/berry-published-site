## About
This site is to give you a general overview of both myself, as well as some useful tools for web development. It also has a secondary function for you to make fun of whatever spelling mistakes I will inevitably make.

## Recommended Tools

- Basic knowledge of [git](https://github.com/).
- Some text way to edit text. (Github can work for now)
- Knowledge of Either HTML and CSS, or Markdown

## Useful Resources

- Both [Notepadd++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are greate tools for text editing. 
- If you do chose to use one of the two editors listed above, you should download Github Desktop, whcih you can get from Git (already linked).
- If you are a windows user, [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is an extremly useful tool for downloading resources
